[IMPORTANT]:
    As of MySQL 5.7.12 the default --early-plugin-load value is empty, To load keyring_file plugin,
you must use an explicit early-plugin-load option with a nonempty value.
    --early-plugin-load="keyring_file;..." semicolon-separated list.
    reason: InnoDB tablespace encryption requires the keyring_file plugin loaded before InnoDB initialization

    You must Run mysql_upgrade with administrator privileges.

[Note]
    If you run the server with the disabled_storage_engines system variable to sop some engine.
    mysql_upgrade might fail with an error like this:

        "mysql_upgrade: [ERROR] 3161: Storage engine MyISAM is disabled
         (Table creation is disallowed)."

    为了解决这个问题，需要关掉 disabled_storage_engines 选项，然后运行mysql_upgrade, 接着在将 disabled_storage_engines恢复
